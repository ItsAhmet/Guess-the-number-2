# Guess-the-number-2


PRACTICE 3 - Guess The Computer’s Number
Write a program that randomly generates a number between 1-100 (inclusive on both endpoints), and then asks the user to guess that “magic” number. Each time the user guesses a number, the program should either print out “Your number is too high” if the user’s input was greater than the magic number, “Your number is too low” if the user’s input was less than the magic number, or “You guessed the right number!” if the user’s input was equal to the magic number. The program should keep going until the user guesses the correct number. At the end, your program should also print out the randomly generated number so you can check that it’s working. It is required that your program uses some kind of loop, and it is recommended that you use a while loop.
